                            <p>"Our stay at Matoshree Resort was delightful! The ambiance is peaceful, and the
                                resort is
                                surrounded by lush greenery. The food was excellent, with a good mix of local and
                                continental dishes. The staff was friendly and always ready to assist. The only
                                slight
                                downside was that the swimming pool was a bit crowded during peak hours, but it
                                didnâ€™t
                                spoil
                                our overall experience. The river park is a beautiful spot to relax, and we loved
                                the
                                evening bonfire. A great place for a family or romantic getaway!"
